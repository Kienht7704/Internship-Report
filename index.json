The protocol provides a consistent way to pass context between an application and a model regardless of where or how the model is deployed. MCP helps close the gap between model deployment and application development by offering a unified interface for model interactions.\nWhile MCP provides flexibility in tool choice, there are important challenges when you need to enforce an order of tool usage. In this article, I describe how I designed this capability and implemented it in the AWS Cloud Control API (CCAPI) MCP server.\nThe challenge — enforcing tool order in MCP When you think about MCP, you naturally imagine flexibility. One of the primary reasons to use an MCP server is to let a large language model (LLM), via an agent, access a set of tools such as reading from a database, sending an email, or other helper functions. However, the MCP framework does not provide an intrinsic mechanism to force the order in which tools are called.\nFor example: consider two tools, fetch_weather_data() and send_email(). You want to ensure the email includes current weather — meaning fetch_weather_data() must run before send_email(). Or consider getOrderId() and getOrderDetail(), where you must obtain the OrderId before fetching detailed order information. Because MCP currently lacks a way to define tool-order preferences, enforcing such sequential relationships is difficult.\nMCP tools are designed as independent functions the LLM can call when needed. There is no concept of a workflow or sequence inside the MCP framework itself. Each tool invocation is treated as a separate task with no built-in knowledge of what happened before or what will happen next. As a result, by default an LLM may call tools in any order, ignoring the logical sequence you might expect.\nWhile LLMs are excellent at flexible decision-making, certain use cases like infrastructure management require strict ordering. This raises the question for MCP server developers: how do you preserve LLM flexibility while enforcing the required order of critical tools?\nWhen you think about Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you expect repeatability, consistency, versioning, and CI/CD integration. CI/CD pipelines follow a defined sequence:\nPull request is created CI/CD pipeline triggers A series of steps run (linting, security checks, unit tests, end-to-end tests, etc.) If any step fails, the pipeline stops The non-deterministic nature of AI complicates this: generative AI is not deterministic — the same prompt might not always produce the same result. If outputs deviate too much from expectations, that\u0026rsquo;s considered a hallucination. So how do you guide an LLM to do what you want? Let\u0026rsquo;s look at how the CCAPI MCP server addresses this.\nUnderstanding tool discovery and initialization in MCP Before diving into the solution, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand how an MCP server communicates available tools to AI agents. During initialization, MCP defines lifecycle stages where capabilities and tools are discovered.\nThe MCP context model defines a structured lifecycle for the client-server connection that negotiates capabilities and manages state. The stages include:\nInitialization: negotiate capabilities and protocol versions Operation: normal protocol communication Shutdown: gracefully close the connection Initialization establishes compatibility and shares implementation details. This is when an AI agent learns about available tools via schema definitions and receives usage guidance. Initialization is critical because tools are discovered at this stage. The client sends protocol version information, capability declarations, and deployment details during initialization.\nFor example, a tool like an Amazon Q CLI receives information about the MCP server version, available tools, and usage guidance via schemas sent by the server.\n(See the MCP lifecycle documentation for more details: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle.)\nSolution — token-based tool orchestration: a new pattern for MCP agents MCP faces a challenge: tools cannot directly talk to each other to enforce an execution order. The CCAPI MCP server solves this by using a token messenger pattern, where the server issues and controls verification tokens, and the AI agent (the MCP client) passes those tokens between tool invocations.\nKey implementation details Function enhancement\nA @mcp.tool() decorator turns each function into an enhanced entity. It wraps the function with a schema that defines required inputs and validation rules while preserving the docstring. Each function explicitly exposes its requirements and raises clear errors if dependencies are not met.\nDependency discovery\nDuring MCP initialization the AI agent receives a full map of tools and their schemas from the MCP server. The LLM (acting inside the agent) uses these schemas to infer dependencies through parameter descriptions and required inputs.\nFor example, if a tool requires a parameter described as \u0026ldquo;Result from get_aws_session_info()\u0026rdquo; and declares security_scan_token as a required input, the LLM will understand that it needs valid tokens before continuing. The combination of textual descriptions and clear required inputs enables the agent to execute a chain like get_aws_session_info() → generate_infrastructure_code() → run_checkov() → create_resource().\nToken validation control\nThe server issues and controls all workflow tokens via a server-side store (_workflow_store). Each tool in the workflow emits a security token that is stored on the server with associated metadata.\nThe AI agent holds tokens in its chat context and passes them between tool calls. Each token used by the agent must be validated against the server-side store. Tokens are short-lived, kept in memory, actively managed, and removed after use to preserve freshness. Any leftover tokens are cleared when the server process shuts down or restarts.\nIf a token does not exist in the store (because it is invalid or was already consumed), the operation immediately fails with an error. This applies to all token types and ensures that the agent cannot fabricate or modify tokens.\nAs the workflow progresses, a tool consumes existing tokens and produces new tokens. For example, when explain() receives a properties_token, it validates that the token exists and matches the _workflow_store, then consumes it and emits a new explained_properties_token. This approach forms a cryptographic-like chain of operations that enforces workflow order (generate → scan → create) with server-side verification at each step.\nThe result is a predictable workflow system with strong security controls — tokens must be issued by the server and validated against the server store at every step — which enforces tool ordering and data integrity in infrastructure operations. This approach enables reliable workflow execution within the constraints of the current FastMCP framework.\nWhile explicit dependency declarations like @mcp.tool(depends_on=[\u0026quot;run_checkov\u0026quot;]) (as discussed in a GitHub issue) may be ideal in future versions, the token approach combining descriptive parameter names and explicit validation currently provides a stable ordering mechanism the LLM will follow.\nPotential limitations and mitigations Session management\nWhen an agent session terminates or refreshes, any in-progress workflows must restart. This is by design — tokens are short-lived and bound to a specific workflow chain. AWS credentials naturally expire after a few hours as part of standard security policies, which provides a natural boundary for workflow sessions.\nConcurrent workflows\nEach agent interaction is isolated, which is appropriate to maintain security boundaries between workflows. While this means each session starts fresh, it guarantees clear separation between independent infrastructure operations.\nImplementation options\nOrganizations that require long-lived workflow state can use a traditional database to persist session state across restarts. However, because tokens are designed as short-lived security controls, many deployments can rely on in-memory storage with the natural session boundary.\nThe token messenger pattern provides a robust foundation for secure workflow coordination, using ephemeral tokens to guarantee tool ordering and data integrity when operating on infrastructure.\nThe future of MCP While the solution works, it also suggests future directions for MCP. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen multiple updates to the framework recently, and it\u0026rsquo;s encouraging to see community activity. With agentic AI overall, there\u0026rsquo;s evidence that platforms can become more deterministic (as emphasized by \u0026ldquo;hooks\u0026rdquo; in Claude Code). According to the docs, “Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude Code behavior, ensuring some actions always occur rather than relying on the LLM to choose.” For IaC and other deterministic technologies we want to pair with AI, that determinism is essential for enterprise adoption.\nConclusion The Model Context Protocol (MCP) journey and the emerging space of AI-driven infrastructure management continue to evolve, bringing both opportunities and challenges to cloud computing and AI. Current approaches like prompt loading and parameter-driven dependencies have helped address early ordering and security concerns, showing MCP can be used effectively in enterprise applications.\nWhile the present implementation using workflow tokens and validation checks provides a workable solution, we continue to explore ways to enhance the protocol.

This MCP server transforms AWS infrastructure management by allowing developers to create, read, update, delete, and list resources using natural language commands. The project is part of awslabs/mcp — an experimental effort to bridge conversational intent and infrastructure operations on AWS.\nThe CCAPI MCP Server is powered by the AWS Cloud Control API — a standardized API that performs CRUDL (Create/Read/Update/Delete/List) operations across AWS and third-party resources through a single access point.\nKey features Uses AWS Cloud Control API to perform CRUDL operations for over 1,200 AWS resource types\nEnables LLM-based agents and developers to manage infrastructure via natural language\nOptionally exports Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates for created resources so you can integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines\nIntegrates with the AWS Pricing API to provide cost estimates for the infrastructure it will create\nApplies security best practices automatically via Checkov\nWhy use the CCAPI MCP Server? Simpler infrastructure management: no more wrestling with complex config templates or long manuals\nIncreased developer productivity: focus on intent, not the exact configuration syntax\nLower onboarding friction: new team members can perform common infra tasks with natural language\nLLM integration: a natural companion for AI-assisted development workflows\nThe MCP Server lets developers manage cloud resources with conversational commands such as:\n“Can you create a new S3 bucket for me?” “List all my EC2 instances and tell me which ones are not t2.large” This reduces configuration overhead and makes intent-to-infrastructure mappings more direct.\nHow to create and manage cloud resources Prerequisites A package manager (pip) installed\nPython 3.x\nAWS credentials configured with appropriate permissions. The MCP server supports multiple ways to provide credentials — see the MCP documentation for details. We recommend using dynamic credentials (for example, via SSO). For AWS credential configuration guidance, consult the AWS CLI documentation.\nAn MCP host application that can run both MCP clients and MCP servers (for example: Amazon Q Developer, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.). To follow the examples in this post, install Amazon Q Developer for CLI as described in its installation guide.\nIntegration with developer tools To start using the CCAPI MCP Server, configure the server settings (typically in a file named mcp.json). This post focuses on using the CCAPI MCP Server with Amazon Q Developer. Note that other MCP host apps may use different locations for their MCP config files.\nConfiguration locations include:\nGlobal configuration: ~/.aws/amazon/mcp.json — applies to all workspaces Workspace configuration: .amazonq/mcp.json — applies to the current workspace See the Amazon Q Developer User Guide for more details.\nConfiguration file structure The MCP config uses JSON. Example configuration screenshots are shown below.\nExample mcp.json for the CCAPI MCP Server:\nImportant configuration notes Ensure you configure AWS credentials properly for the MCP server. The server uses those credentials when calling Cloud Control API to perform CRUDL operations in your AWS account. The server supports various credential sources such as AWS profiles, environment variables, SSO tokens, etc. See aws_client.py in the project for examples and refer to named profile documentation for more details.\nRead-only mode If you want the MCP server to avoid making mutating actions (Create/Update/Delete), run it with the --readonly flag.\nSecurity considerations Ensure the IAM credentials used have the permissions required by the Cloud Control API (List, Get, Create, Update, Delete). Consult the AWS CCAPI docs for details. Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring IAM permissions. Enable AWS CloudTrail to record and audit operations. Consider running the server in read-only mode (--readonly) for safer operation when appropriate. Example: Create an S3 bucket encrypted with KMS Important: Ensure you’ve satisfied the prerequisites before running the example.\nOnce mcp.json is configured correctly, try the example. In your terminal, run q chat to start Amazon Q in the CLI.\nThat command starts background MCP servers, allowing Q Chat to use them even while startup continues. If the MCP servers are still loading, your prompts may be processed without using MCP servers. To check server status, run /mcp.\nWhen servers are ready, try a sample prompt. Tell Amazon Q: Create an S3 bucket with versioning and encrypt it using a new KMS key.\nAmazon Q will automatically perform these steps:\nRead your current environment variables Use them to retrieve the current AWS session info Generate infrastructure code describing the requested resources Explain the generated code Run a security scan on the generated code (if enabled) Explain the scan results Validate the configuration against Cloud Control API schemas (based on CloudFormation Resource Provider Schemas) and IAM policies Create resources directly via Cloud Control API Note: CloudFormation schemas are used for resource structure reference only — CCAPI MCP Server uses Cloud Control API for resource management rather than CloudFormation itself.\nBefore taking destructive actions, Amazon Q will summarize the steps and request confirmation (type y to proceed when prompted).\nNext, Amazon Q may call get_aws_session_info() to fetch session details according to values in your MCP config (e.g., ~/.aws/amazon/mcp.json) and environment variables.\nThe tool will then display the AWS account ID and region it will use, generate infrastructure code for the KMS key (and related properties), and send the properties to Cloud Control API for validation and Checkov scanning. The KMS key will be configured with recommended security practices and a key policy constrained to the current account.\nAfter the code is generated, Amazon Q will use explain() to describe the generated infrastructure code. The MCP server automatically adds default tags to managed resources: MANAGED_BY, MCP_SERVER_SOURCE_CODE, MCP_SERVER_VERSION. These tags help you identify resources managed by the MCP Server; you can customize or disable them, but keeping identifying tags is recommended for visibility.\nAmazon Q will then run run_checkov() to perform a security scan on the generated code (this runs automatically if SECURITY_SCANNING is enabled in your server config).\nIf Checkov finds issues, Amazon Q will explain the findings and suggest remediations. Passing checks proceed automatically with a short summary; request more detail if needed.\nNext, Amazon Q uses create_resource() to create resources via Cloud Control API, then polls get_resource_request_status() using the request token to track progress.\nAmazon Q will continue using CCAPI MCP Server tools until the S3 bucket and KMS key are created, then produce a summary of the workflow.\nTry asking Amazon Q to perform a potentially risky change (for example, make an S3 bucket publicly accessible). Amazon Q will warn that the change violates best practices, explain why, and request confirmation before proceeding.\nThe CCAPI MCP Server integrates with AWS Pricing API so you can request cost estimates for resources it plans to create.\nYou can also ask Amazon Q to generate a CloudFormation template of the resources it created so you can save a backup or redeploy later. The create_template() tool has these defaults:\nOutputs YAML by default (JSON option available) Sets DeletionPolicy = RETAIN Sets UpdateReplacePolicy = RETAIN Allows optional parameters such as template ID, file location, and region Refer to the tool’s source code for more details.\nTry another risky operation, like deleting all resources in an account — the security checks will block the attempt and propose safer alternatives.\nFinally, ask Amazon Q to delete the resources it previously created. The toolchain will:\nUse get_resource() to find the resources it created Use explain() to describe the planned changes Use delete_resource() to remove them After successful deletion, Amazon Q shows a final summary.\nStarter prompts Sample prompts “Create a VPC with private and public subnets” “List all my EC2 instances” “Create a serverless API for my application” “Set up a load-balanced web application” Capabilities Provision a full networking environment with private and public subnets List all running EC2 instances in your account Deploy an API Gateway integrated with Lambda (serverless) Create a load-balanced web application (ALB) with a target group and instances Conclusion The AWS Cloud Control API MCP Server is an important step forward for AWS infrastructure management, enabling natural-language-driven operations. Whether you’re optimizing operations, experimenting with AI, or onboarding new team members — via Amazon Q Developer CLI or any MCP host (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) — the CCAPI MCP Server and its companion tools provide an intuitive interface to AWS.\n"},{"uri":"https://Kienht7704.github.io/Internship-Report/","title":"Internship Report","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Internship Report Student Information: Full Name: Huynh Trung Kien\nPhone Number: 0964325416\nEmail: kienhtse184454@fpt.edu.vn\nUniversity: FPT University\nMajor: Software Engineer\nClass: AWS082025\nInternship Company: Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.\nInternship Position: FCJ Cloud Intern\nInternship Duration: From 08/09/2025 to \u0026hellip;\nReport Content Worklog Proposal Translated Blogs Events Participated Workshop Self-evaluation Sharing and Feedback "},{"uri":"https://Kienht7704.github.io/Internship-Report/5-workshop/5.1-workshop-overview/","title":"Introduction","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Workshop Overview In this workshop you will build a complete personal portfolio website using a serverless architecture on AWS — no server management or scaling worries required.\nWorkshop Architecture The workshop leverages two main AWS services:\nAmazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) — serves as the static web server for files such as HTML, CSS and images.

Background What is S3? Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is AWS\u0026rsquo;s object storage service. You can think of S3 as a huge \u0026ldquo;cloud hard drive\u0026rdquo; for storing files.\nWhat is S3 Static Website Hosting? S3 offers a feature that lets you host static websites (HTML, CSS, JS, images) without a web server. Key benefits:\nCheap (~$0.023/GB/month) No server management Automatic scaling for traffic spikes 11 nines of durability (99.999999999%) Step 1: Access the AWS Console 1.1 Sign in to AWS Open your browser and go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com Sign in with either: Root user email + password, OR IAM user (if provided by your organization) Select the region Asia Pacific (Singapore) ap-southeast-1 in the top-right corner Why Singapore? It\u0026rsquo;s geographically close to Vietnam, so it provides lower latency and reasonable pricing.\n1.2 Find the S3 service Type \u0026ldquo;S3\u0026rdquo; into the service search box in the console header Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket 2.1 Start creating the bucket In the S3 Console, click the orange Create bucket button 2. The bucket creation form includes several options 2.2 General configuration Bucket name:\nportfolio-yourname-2025 Important notes about bucket names:\nThe name must be globally unique (no other AWS account can use the same name) Use only lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens (-) No Vietnamese characters, no spaces Length between 3 and 63 characters Valid examples:\nportfolio-anhnguyen-2024 my-awesome-website-123 test-bucket-hcm AWS Region:\nAsia Pacific (Singapore) ap-southeast-1 2.3 Object ownership ACLs disabled (recommended) Explanation: ACLs are an older access control mechanism. AWS recommends using Bucket Policies for easier management.\n2.4 Block Public Access configuration IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY:\nBy default AWS blocks all public access for security. Because this bucket will host a public website, you need to disable those blocks for this bucket:\nUncheck all 4 options under \u0026ldquo;Block Public Access\u0026rdquo;:\nBlock all public access Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs) Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs) Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies A yellow security warning will appear after you uncheck them\nSecurity warning: Only do this for a bucket that hosts a public website. Do not disable public access on buckets that store sensitive data.\n2.5 Finish Click the Create bucket button at the bottom of the page.\nStep 3: Upload Files to S3 3.1 Open the newly created bucket In the buckets list, click the name of the bucket you created You\u0026rsquo;ll land on the Objects view (file listing) 3.2 Upload files Click the orange Upload button Click Add files Select the two files: index.html and error.html from your my-portfolio folder Click Open You should see both files listed:\n📄 index.html 📄 error.html 3.3 Keep default upload settings Scroll to the bottom and click Upload Wait for the progress bar to reach 100% You should see \u0026ldquo;Upload succeeded\u0026rdquo; for both files Click Close to return to the bucket view 3.5 Confirm upload You should now see the two files in the bucket:\nName Type Size Last modified index.html text/html ~8 KB Just now error.html text/html ~1 KB Just now Checkpoint: Files are uploaded to S3!\nStep 4: Enable Static Website Hosting 4.1 Open Properties tab While inside the bucket, click the Properties tab Scroll to the bottom 4.2 Find Static website hosting Locate the Static website hosting section — it should display Disabled initially\n4.3 Enable and configure Click Edit inside the Static website hosting section Configure as shown in the screenshots Click Save changes 4.4 Save the Website Endpoint URL After saving, the Bucket website endpoint will appear.

Executive Summary This proposal presents the implementation plan for Aurora Time, a time management application on the AWS platform, simple and focused on scheduling features, to address the complexity and operational costs of current solutions. Aurora Time will leverage AWS serverless and managed services to ensure high scalability, reliability, and cost optimization, delivering rapid return on investment (ROI) through reduced infrastructure management costs.\n2. Problem Statement Current Problem Individuals struggle to manage daily commitments because schedules are scattered (notes, phones) leading to confusion and missed tasks. Current tools are often too complex, overloaded with work features, and unsuitable for the need for quick and simple scheduling in personal life. Aurora Time solves this by providing a centralized, minimalist, and intuitive platform to easily track habits and important milestones.\nSolution The platform uses Amazon S3 combined with Amazon CloudFront to store and distribute web applications, using AWS Amplify for rapid development and deployment. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda serve as the Backend processing layer to handle event CRUD requests. Data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB to ensure fast access speed and low latency. Amazon Cognito ensures secure authentication and authorization for each individual user. Amazon EventBridge and Amazon SES are used to trigger and send scheduled reminder notifications. Similar to other calendar applications, users can create and edit personal schedules, but this platform operates at a more minimalist scale and serves the purpose of daily personal time management. Key features include intuitive scheduling interface, customizable reminders, and low operational costs.\nBenefits and Return on Investment (ROI) The Aurora Time solution creates a solid foundation for individual users to centralize all schedules while providing a cost-saving Serverless architecture model for easy feature expansion. The platform reduces schedule fragmentation and minimizes missed important commitments through a centralized, simple reminder system, simplifying personal time management and improving work/life balance.\nEstimated monthly infrastructure costs of $16 - $50 USD, totaling approximately $192 - $600 USD for 12 months (depending on number of users and requests). All development components are based on Serverless, incurring no hardware purchases or 24/7 virtual server rental costs. The payback period is estimated at under 6 months thanks to significant time savings in searching and manually arranging schedules, and the extremely low operational costs of the AWS Serverless architecture.\n3. Solution Architecture The platform applies AWS Serverless architecture to manage personal schedule and event data, with the capability to easily scale from a single user to millions of individual users. API requests are received through Amazon API Gateway and processed by AWS Lambda, while data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB to ensure fast query speed and low latency. Amazon EventBridge handles reminder scheduling logic, triggers Lambda, and sends notifications. AWS Amplify provides an intuitive web/mobile interface, secured by Amazon Cognito to safely manage access permissions for each user.\nAWS Services Used AWS Lambda: Processes business logic for event CRUD operations and triggers scheduled reminder tasks. Amazon API Gateway: Provides secure RESTful API interface for communication with web applications. Amazon DynamoDB: Stores event data, schedules, and user information. Amazon S3 and CloudFront: Stores and distributes static content of Frontend applications. Amazon EventBridge: Schedules and triggers automatic reminder events at user-defined times. Amazon SES: Sends customized reminder notifications via email (SES). AWS Amplify: Stores and provides intuitive web interface. Amazon Cognito: Manages access permissions and secure authentication for individual users. Component Design User Interface: AWS Amplify hosts web applications (planned to use React) providing intuitive scheduling interface, schedule viewing, and reminder settings. User Authentication: Amazon Cognito manages individual user accounts, issuing secure authorization tokens for Backend API access. API Request Reception: Amazon API Gateway receives and routes authenticated requests (e.g., create event, query schedule) to corresponding Lambda functions. Backend Logic Processing: AWS Lambda processes and executes business logic. Meanwhile, other Lambda functions are triggered by EventBridge to send reminders. Data Storage: Amazon DynamoDB stores primary data (Schedules, Events, User Information) in NoSQL format, ensuring fast access and flexibility. Reminder Scheduling: Amazon EventBridge schedules and triggers events at user-defined times, ensuring reminder features operate automatically. Web Interface: AWS Amplify hosts a Next.js app for real-time dashboards and analytics. User Management: Amazon Cognito manages user access, allowing up to 5 active accounts. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nThe project consists of 2 parts — Backend Serverless setup and Frontend User Interface building — each part goes through 4 phases:\nResearch and Architecture Design: In-depth research on DynamoDB Data Modeling for schedules and design of verified AWS Serverless architecture (API Gateway, Lambda, EventBridge). (Timeline: Month 1) Cost Calculation and Feasibility Check: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate actual Serverless operational costs and verify feasibility of authentication (Cognito) and storage (DynamoDB) flows. (Timeline: Month 1) Architecture Adjustment for Cost/Solution Optimization: Fine-tune Lambda parameters (e.g., memory, timeout) and DynamoDB (e.g., RCU/WCU) to ensure highest cost efficiency and best performance for individual users. (Timeline: Month 2) Development, Testing, Deployment: Program Lambda functions, set up CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CloudFormation, and develop Frontend applications (React). Then conduct Beta testing and go live. (Timeline: Month 2-3) Technical Requirements\n1. Backend Requirements (Serverless)\nCore Services: In-depth knowledge of AWS Lambda (Node.js), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon Cognito. Event Management: Proficiency in Amazon EventBridge to schedule and trigger Lambda functions sending reminders via Amazon SES/SNS. 2. Frontend Requirements\nInterface: Practical knowledge of AWS Amplify to host React applications and connect to API Gateway Optimization: Leverage React\u0026rsquo;s processing capabilities to reduce load on Lambda functions 5. Roadmap \u0026amp; Deployment Milestones Internship (Month 1–3): Month 1: Learn AWS and upgrade hardware. Month 2: Design and adjust architecture. Month 3: Deploy, test, and go live. Post-Deployment: Further research over 1 year. 6.

Risk Assessment Risk Matrix\nNetwork disconnection/High latency: Medium impact, medium probability. DynamoDB design error: High impact, medium probability. Serverless costs exceed budget: Medium impact, low probability. Reminder system failure: High impact, low probability. Mitigation Strategies\nNetwork disconnection/High latency: Optimize Frontend (stored on S3/CloudFront) to ensure fast loading speeds, use Client-side Caching so users can still view recent schedules when network is lost. DynamoDB design error: Conduct strict Proof of Concept (POC) and Load Testing for data models. Use optimized Global Secondary Index (GSI) to avoid querying entire table and minimize RCU/WCU costs. Serverless costs exceed budget: Set up AWS Budgets with proactive alerts (Email/SNS) when spending approaches threshold. Regularly check AWS Cost Explorer and optimize Lambda resources. Reminder system failure: Closely monitor EventBridge and Lambda reminder processing through CloudWatch Alarms to detect errors immediately. Implement Retry Logic for critical Lambda functions. Contingency Plan\nAWS Incident: Since the application is only for individuals, if AWS encounters an incident, the system will be configured to automatically Rollback to the latest code version (via CodePipeline) or re-deploy configuration (via CloudFormation). Data Loss: Set up DynamoDB Backup and Restore at regular intervals to quickly recover event data in case of system failure or user error. Cost Issues: Use CloudFormation to restore resource configuration (such as RCU/WCU) to proven low-cost state. 8. Expected Results User Experience Improvement: Provide intuitive scheduling interface and real-time notifications (Real-time notifications) replacing manual note-taking and schedule tracking processes. The system is designed for easy scaling, serving from a single user to millions of individual users.\nLong-term Value and Reusability: Create a solid Serverless technical platform that can maintain operation at extremely low costs for many years. This architecture can be reused for personal application projects or other expansion features in the future (e.g., habit tracking, simple personal task management).\nSuccessful Deployment: Successfully deploy the entire approved Serverless architecture, including automated CI/CD and core features of Aurora Time within the planned timeframe.\n"},{"uri":"https://Kienht7704.github.io/Internship-Report/1-worklog/1.10-week10/","title":"Week 10 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The following information is for reference purposes only.
