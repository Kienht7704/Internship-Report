###  [Blog 1 - AWS Powers Breakthrough Gaming Experiences at devcom and gamescom 2025](3.1-Blog1/)
This post summarizes AWS activities and sessions at devcom and gamescom 2025. It highlights AWS for Games programs, demos, and workshops—covering GameLift and GameLift Streams, AI-powered QA workflows, localization and continuous localization tooling, game analytics pipelines, and partner integrations. The article is useful for game developers interested in cloud-powered streaming, scalability, and AI-driven development workflows.

###  [Blog 2 - Flexibility to Framework: Building MCP Servers with Controlled Tool Orchestration](3.2-Blog2/)
This article explains the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and addresses the challenge of enforcing tool execution order when agents call multiple tools. The author presents a token-based orchestration pattern: the server issues short-lived verification tokens, tools validate tokens against a server-side store, and tokens are consumed/rotated to enforce a secure sequential workflow (generate → scan → create). The post also describes `@mcp.tool()` patterns, dependency discovery, and trade-offs for session and concurrency handling.

###  [Blog 3 - Introducing AWS Cloud Control API MCP Server](3.3-Blog3/)
This post introduces the CCAPI MCP Server, which enables natural-language-driven infrastructure management by using the AWS Cloud Control API to perform CRUDL operations across many AWS resource types. Key features covered include IaC export, cost estimation via the Pricing API, automated security checks with Checkov, read-only mode, and a practical example (create an S3 bucket encrypted with KMS). The article highlights how the server integrates with developer tools (for example Amazon Q Developer) to streamline intent-to-infrastructure workflows.
