### AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1

**- Date:** October 15, 2025
**- Location:** 2 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City

#### Event Overview

An in-depth workshop focused on the comprehensive landscape of AI/ML in Vietnam and hands-on practice with AWS core services for Machine Learning and Generative AI.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Understand the Market:** Grasp the context and development trends of AI/ML in Vietnam.

- **Master SageMaker:** Approach Amazon SageMaker to manage comprehensive ML workflows (End-to-end), from data preparation to MLOps deployment.

- **Explore Generative AI:** Deeply understand Amazon Bedrock, how to select Foundation Models (Claude, Llama, Titan), and Prompt Engineering techniques.

- **RAG & Agent Architecture:** Learn about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and how to integrate Knowledge Base to build intelligent applications.

---

#### Key Takeaways & Learnings

- **SageMaker is a Unified Ecosystem:** Effective ML development requires an integrated platform (Integrated MLOps) that seamlessly connects data labeling through training and tuning.

- **Model Selection Strategy:** There is no one-size-fits-all model. Need to compare and choose between Claude, Llama, and Titan based on specific use cases and costs.

- **RAG is Key for Enterprise GenAI:** To make AI understand business context, use RAG architecture combined with Knowledge Base instead of relying solely on the model's original training data.

- **Security in GenAI:** Using Guardrails is mandatory to filter content and ensure safety and compliance when deploying AI in production.

---

#### Application to Work

- **Re-evaluate Current ML Workflow:** Use knowledge from SageMaker Studio demo to review current team MLOps workflow, identify bottlenecks in data preparation or deployment phases.

- **Build POC Chatbot:** Plan to build an internal Chatbot using Amazon Bedrock combined with RAG (using company documents as Knowledge Base) as demonstrated in the Live Demo.

- **Optimize Prompts:** Immediately apply "Chain-of-Thought reasoning" and "Few-shot learning" techniques to current AI tasks to improve result accuracy.

- **Set up Guardrails:** Configure content filtering for GenAI applications in development to minimize information security risks.
