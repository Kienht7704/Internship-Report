### AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2

**- Date:** November 17, 2025
**- Location:** AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, HCMC


---

#### Event Overview

A full-day in-depth workshop on DevOps culture and tools on the AWS platform, covering the entire software development lifecycle from management philosophy to infrastructure operations and system monitoring.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Shape DevOps Mindset:** Understand DevOps culture and key performance indicators for efficiency measurement (DORA metrics, MTTR).

- **Automate Processes (CI/CD):** Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines using the AWS Code Series tools.

- **Modernize with Containers:** Master the strategy for deploying Microservices on Amazon ECS, EKS, and App Runner.

- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Establish full-stack observability capabilities to detect and resolve issues in real-time.

---

#### Key Takeaways & Learnings

- **Automation is the Backbone:** A powerful CI/CD process isn't just about building code—it must include safe deployment strategies like Blue/Green or Canary to minimize downtime risk.

- **IaC Prevents Drift:** Using CloudFormation or CDK ensures consistent environments and avoids "configuration drift" that often occurs with manual operations.

- **Choose the Right Container Tool:** There's no one-size-fits-all solution; ECS is ideal for deep AWS integration, EKS for scalable open Kubernetes standards, and App Runner for maximum simplicity.

- **Observability > Monitoring:** Monitoring only tells you the system is broken; Observability (via AWS X-Ray) answers why and where the failure occurs in distributed architectures.

---

#### Application to Work

- **Measure Team Performance:** Immediately apply the **DORA metrics** (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, etc.) to evaluate the current state of the team's development process.

- **Upgrade Pipeline:** Review the current pipeline and integrate AWS CodeDeploy to implement **Blue/Green Deployment** strategy for critical services.

- **Migrate to CDK:** Start experimenting with converting a small infrastructure module from pure CloudFormation (YAML/JSON) to AWS CDK to leverage code reusability (Constructs).

- **Optimize Monitoring:** Integrate **AWS X-Ray** into existing Microservices applications to obtain detailed trace maps, reducing error investigation time (MTTR).
