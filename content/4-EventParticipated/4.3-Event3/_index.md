### AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 - Deep Dive into AI-Driven Development

**- Date:** December 1, 2025
**- Location:** Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City


---

#### Event Overview

A sharing session focused on the shift in software development processes in the AI era (AI-Driven Development), introducing advanced programming assistant tools to optimize technical team performance.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Approach AIDDLC:** Understand the concept of "AI-Driven Development Life Cycle" - a software development process driven by AI.

- **Experience Amazon Q Developer:** See a live demo of how AWS's AI assistant supports programming and infrastructure problem-solving (Speaker: Toan Huynh).

- **Explore Kiro Tool:** Learn about the features and practical applications of Kiro through an in-depth demo (Speaker: My Nguyen).

---

#### Key Takeaways & Learnings

- **The Rise of AIDDLC:** Software development is no longer just manual coding. AI is now participating in the entire lifecycle from suggesting architecture, writing test cases, to debugging and maintenance.

- **Amazon Q - More Than a Code Generator:** Amazon Q Developer not only generates code but also deeply understands AWS infrastructure context, helping solve operational and security problems directly in the IDE.

- **Optimization with Specialized Tools (Kiro):** Combining different AI tools (like Kiro) into the workflow helps solve specific bottlenecks that general-purpose tools may not fully cover.

---

#### Application to Work

- **Shift Mindset to AIDDLC:** Organize a team meeting to introduce the AI-oriented development model, encouraging the adoption of an AI-first mindset using AI as a primary support tool.

- **Deploy Pilot Amazon Q:** Install and test Amazon Q Developer for a small project or core team to measure productivity improvement (reduced documentation search time, faster bug fixes).

- **Evaluate Kiro's Fit:** Based on the demo, analyze which problems Kiro solves best (Testing, Documentation, or Automation) and determine if it's suitable for integration into the current tech stack.
